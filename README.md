General function: UdpSobs implements a simple online bidding system using the UDP protocol. It can run on either Server mode or Client mode. The users of this system include sellers and customers. Sellers can post item entries on the Server and all customers can view the item list. If a customer is interested in one of the items, he can directly contact the seller to request more information or to place a bid. Sellers and customers all act as clients, and the server keeps track of all information such as client information, item list and off-line messages. Clients should also be able to send messages to each other, so that a customer can contact a seller directly.
